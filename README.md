# Semi-automated Pipeline for Structural Analysis of Compressed Spinal Cord in DCM

## Description

This repository contains the code for pre-processing structural T2-weighted, T2-star, and magnetization transfer MRI images. The primary goal is to estimate biomarkers such as spinal cord atrophy, gray matter atrophy, and white matter injury in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). This pipeline is designed to provide reproducible, standardized, and localized measures of spinal cord injury.
